      <li>Link to our style sheet will be entered in the head element.</li>
      <li>Link element creates the connection to an external file.</li>
      <li>rel attributes specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
      <li>Class attributes allow us to share CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>

       <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
      
      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
      <li>To declare a variable use the var keyword.</li>
      <li>After your var keyword, we give the variable a name, which must be unique and reference info stored in variable.</li>
      <li>Use an assignment operator = to assign the sepecific data that we want stored in the variable in our code.</li>
      <li>Ex: var shape="circle";</li>
      <li>Variable contains string and is contained within the quotation marks.</li>
      <li>Each line of JS ends with a semicolon ;.</li>
      <li>console.log method outputs a message to the web console by adding an arguement and makes it easier to code.</li>
      <li>Connect script.js to index.html by adding script element under the footer</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
      <li>Codes run top to bottom.</li>
      <li>Control flow can be interrupted if we use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all. </li>
      <li>if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code and will only execute if the statement is true, or meets a condition.</li>
      <li>We use else if statement if there is more than one condition.</li>
      <li>=== is a strict equality operator and checks to see if two values are equal. </li>
      <li>Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data which makes it useful to perform task on multiple pieces of data at once. </li>
      <li>Array index starts at 0.</li>
      <li>for loop uses predictable pattern of indices to perform task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
      <li>In order to use for loop we need index and array length.</li>
      <li>Array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no more items left in the array.</li>
      <li>Length can be found using a built in property of an array, named length.</li>
      <li>For loop contains 3 important statements: <br>
      Starting point for our loop. <br>
      Condition<br>
      Code block; what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
